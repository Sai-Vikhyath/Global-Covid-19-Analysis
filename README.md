# Global COVID-19 Analysis: Deaths, Cases, and Vaccination Trends Using Power BI and Tableau

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions globally, leaving behind a trail of data that can offer valuable insights into its impact. This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data concerning **total cases**, **deaths**, and **vaccinations** across various regions and countries. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that could inform future pandemic responses or provide historical understanding.

### **Introduction:**
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions globally, leaving behind a trail of data that can offer valuable insights into its impact. This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data concerning **total cases**, **deaths**, and **vaccinations** across various regions and countries. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that could inform future pandemic responses or provide historical understanding.

### **Data Source:**
The goal is to analyze and present COVID-19 related statistics for various countries, regions, and continents. 
The analysis is based on two primary data sources:
1. **CovidDeaths**: A dataset containing detailed records on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data across different regions and countries.
2. **CovidVaccinations**: A dataset tracking the number of vaccinations administered globally, broken down by region and date.
- **Combined Analysis**: Merging both datasets to calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated and comparing vaccination data with total cases and deaths.

---

### **Features:**
The key features utilized for analysis include:
- **Location**: The country or region (e.g., India, United States).
- **Date**: The specific date of data entry, allowing for time-based analysis.
- **Total Cases**: The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **New Cases**: The number of new COVID-19 cases reported for a given day.
- **Total Deaths**: The total number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19.
- **New Deaths**: The number of deaths reported for a given day.
- **Population**: The population of each region or country.
- **New Vaccinations**: The number of new vaccinations administered.
- **Rolling People Vaccinated**: The cumulative number of vaccinations administered up to a given date.

These features were used to calculate important metrics such as death rates, infection percentages, and vaccination coverage.

### **Questions to be Answered:**
The project aims to address the following key questions:
1. **What is the COVID-19 death rate relative to the total number of cases across different countries?**
2. **How does the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 compare across regions?**
3. **What are the countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates relative to their population?**
4. **What is the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination rates and infection/death rates?**
5. **Which regions have made the most progress in vaccinating their populations?**
6. **How does vaccination coverage correlate with the reduction in new cases and deaths over time?**
7. **What are the global trends in COVID-19 infections, deaths, and vaccinations over time?**

---

### **Summary of Findings:**
- **Death Percentage**: The project found that regions with a high number of COVID-19 cases also tend to have high death percentages. However, there is significant variation depending on factors such as healthcare infrastructure and response strategies.
- **COVID-19 Infection Rates**: Countries with high populations, like India and the United States, saw a larger proportion of their population infected, though the spread varied greatly over time and location.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Vaccination efforts have shown varying levels of success across regions. Countries with higher vaccination rates generally reported a lower increase in new cases and deaths, though this is not always directly correlated, suggesting other variables at play.
- **Regional Disparities**: Some continents (such as Europe and North America) demonstrated faster vaccination rollouts, while others (such as Africa) lagged behind in both cases and vaccinations, reflecting global inequality.
- **Effectiveness of Vaccinations**: Areas with higher vaccination coverage saw a notable reduction in the number of severe cases and deaths, highlighting the importance of vaccination in controlling the spread of the virus.

### **Conclusion:**
This project offers a detailed, data-driven analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic and its global impact. By combining death and case data with vaccination statistics, it provides valuable insights into how different regions have been affected by the virus and the role of vaccination in mitigating the crisis. The findings underscore the importance of timely and widespread vaccination campaigns to reduce the mortality rate and curb the spread of COVID-19. Moving forward, the continued analysis of these trends will be crucial in guiding future public health policies and pandemic management strategies.
